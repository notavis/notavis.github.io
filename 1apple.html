                Apples are a type of fruit that are round in shape, typically red,<br>green, or yellow 
                in colour, and have a firm, juicy flesh. They are a popular<br>fruit that can be eaten raw or cooked 
                in a variety of dishes, such as pies,<br>sauces, and cider. Apples are high in fiber and vitamin C, 
                and are also a<br>good source of antioxidants. They are commonly grown in temperate<br>regions around 
                the world, and there are many different varieties of<br>apples with varying flavors and textures. 
                Some popular types of apples<br>include Granny Smith, Red Delicious, and Honeycrisp.
