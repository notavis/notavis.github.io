            <h1>The<br>Mango</h1>
            <p>
                Mangos are a type of tropical fruit that are native to South Asia, 
                but are now<br>cultivated in many tropical and subtropical regions 
                around the world. They<br>have a sweet, juicy flesh that is typically 
                orange or yellow in color and a large,<br>flat pit in the center. Mangos 
                are a popular fruit that can be eaten raw or used<br>in a variety of 
                dishes, such as smoothies, salads, and desserts. They are high<br>in fiber, 
                vitamin C, and vitamin A, and are also a good source of other essential<br> 
                nutrients. There are many different varieties of mangos with varying 
                sizes,<br>colours, and flavors. Some popular types of mangos include Alphonso,<br> 
                Ataulfo, and Tommy Atkins.
