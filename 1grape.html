                Grapes are a type of fruit that grow in clusters on vines and come in a<br> 
                variety of colours, including green, red, purple, and black. They have<br>a 
                sweet, juicy flesh and a small seed in the center. Grapes are a popular<br> 
                fruit that can be eaten fresh or used in a variety of dishes, such as 
                salads,<br>jams, and wine. They are high in antioxidants, fiber, and vitamin 
                C, and<br>are also a good source of other essential nutrients. Grapes are 
                cultivated<br>in many regions around the world, and there are many different 
                varieties<br>with varying flavours and textures. Some popular types of grapes 
                include<br>Thompson seedless, Concord, and Cabernet Sauvignon.
