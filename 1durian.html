            <h1>The<br>Durian</h1>
            <p>
                Durian is a tropical fruit that is native to Southeast Asia, known for its 
                distinctively<br>strong and pungent odor. The fruit is large and spiky with a 
                green or brown exterior,<br>and a creamy yellow or orange flesh inside. Durian 
                is considered a delicacy in<br>many parts of Asia, and is used in a variety of 
                dishes such as ice cream, desserts,<br>and candy. Despite its popularity, the 
                fruit's strong odor has led it to be banned from<br>certain public spaces such 
                as hotels and public transportation. Durian is high in fiber,<br>vitamin C, and 
                potassium, and is also a good source of other essential nutrients. It<br>has a 
                unique taste and texture, often described as sweet, creamy, and custard-like,<br> 
                with a slightly bitter aftertaste.
