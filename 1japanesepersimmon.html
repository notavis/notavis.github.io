            <h1>The<br>Persimmon</h1>
            <p>
                Persimmon is a fruit that is native to China and Japan, but is now cultivated<br> 
                in many other regions around the world. It has a round or oblong shape and<br>can 
                range in colour from yellow-orange to deep red. Persimmons have a<br>sweet and 
                juicy flesh that can be eaten fresh or used in a variety of dishes,<br>such as jams, 
                salads, and desserts. There are two main types of persimmons:<br>astringent and 
                non-astringent. Astringent persimmons are high in tannins,<br>which can make them 
                taste bitter and astringent until they are fully ripe.<br>Non-astringent persimmons 
                are sweeter and less astringent, and can be eaten<br>when still firm. Persimmons are 
                high in fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C, and are<br>also a good source of other 
                essential nutrients. Some popular types of<br>persimmons include Fuyu, Hachiya, and 
                Sharon fruit.
