            <h1>The<br>Jackfruit</h1>
            <p>
                Jackfruit is a tropical fruit that is native to Southeast Asia, but is 
                now cultivated<br>in many other regions around the world. It is the largest 
                tree-borne fruit in the<br>world and can weigh up to 80 pounds. Jackfruit 
                has a spiky, greenish-yellow<br>exterior and a creamy yellow flesh inside 
                that is divided into segments. It has<br>a sweet and fruity flavor and can 
                be eaten ripe or unripe. When unripe, jackfruit<br>has a meaty texture and 
                is often used as a vegetarian or vegan meat substitute.<br>When ripe, 
                jackfruit is juicy and has a flavor similar to a mix of pineapple and<br>mango. 
                Jackfruit is high in fiber, vitamin C, and other essential nutrients. 
                It is<br>also a good source of antioxidants and phytonutrients. Some popular 
                uses of<br>jackfruit include curries, stews, and tacos.
