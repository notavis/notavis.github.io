            <h1>The<br>Pineapple</h1>
            <p>
                Pineapple is a tropical fruit that is native to South America, but is 
                now cultivated in many<br>other tropical regions around the world. It has 
                a cylindrical shape with a spiky, rough<br>exterior that ranges in colour 
                from green to yellow. Pineapple has a sweet and juicy flesh<br>that is 
                yellow in colour, with a core that is tougher and less edible. Pineapple 
                can be eaten<br>fresh or used in a variety of dishes, such as salads, 
                smoothies, and desserts. Pineapple<br>is high in vitamin C, manganese, and 
                bromelain, which is an enzyme that may have<br>anti-inflammatory properties. 
                Some popular uses of pineapple include juice, canned slices,<br>and dried fruit.
