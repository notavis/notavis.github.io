            <h1>The<br>Kiwi</h1>
            <p>
                Kiwi is a fruit that is native to China, but is now cultivated 
                in many regions<br>around the world, including New Zealand, where 
                it is also known as "kiwifruit".<br>Kiwis are small and oval-shaped 
                with brown, fuzzy skin and green flesh inside.<br>They have a sweet 
                and tangy flavor and are often eaten raw or used in a<br>variety of 
                dishes, such as fruit salads, smoothies, and desserts. Kiwis are 
                high in<br>vitamin C, vitamin K, and dietary fiber, and are also a 
                good source of other<br>essential nutrients. They are known for their 
                health benefits, including improving<br>digestion, boosting the immune 
                system, and promoting heart health. Some popular<br>types of kiwis 
                include Hayward, Gold, and Baby kiwis.
