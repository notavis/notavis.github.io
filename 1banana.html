                Bananas are a type of fruit that are typically yellow or green in colour 
                and<br>have a soft, sweet flesh. They are a popular fruit that can be eaten 
                raw or<br>cooked in a variety of dishes, such as banana bread, smoothies, and<br>
                desserts. Bananas are high in fiber, vitamin C, and potassium, and are also<br> 
                a good source of other essential nutrients. They are commonly grown in<br>tropical 
                regions around the world, and there are many different varieties of<br>bananas 
                with varying sizes, colors, and flavors. Some popular types<br>of bananas include 
                Cavendish, plantain, and red bananas.
